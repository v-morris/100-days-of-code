# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 15, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Worked more with React app and learned how to dynamically add CSS classes by pushing to an array and using inline styling. Also learned about Radium, which allows you to use pseudo selectors and media queries with inline styling.

**Thoughts:** Very useful knowledge because when I previously worked with React apps this crossed my mind. Thought pseudo selectors and media queries could only be done through style sheets. Radium is going to be extremely helpful for my future React websites.
