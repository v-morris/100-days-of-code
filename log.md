# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 17: September 17, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: I worked in Spring Boot and continued refreshing on MVC and working through basic CRUD operations. I went through part of my bootcamp's curriculum again to get back into the groove of using Spring Boot. I'm refreshing on HTTP requests/responses. I was able to debug and find an error in a piece of curriculum I was reading, so I was super happy to be able to figure that out on my own. It took me a bit to figure it out but I got it :) 

**Thoughts:** I have been terrible at keeping this updated the last few days because I took a little mental break over the weekend, but I did code yesterday. Figured I'd just get this going again now and pick up where I left off! Spring Boot has so much that I have forgotten but it will be fun getting back in to it. Once I remember everything I'd like to build a small application. I've also been working through a lot of interviews so that took up a significant portion of my time last week. Hopefully by the end of this week I will be back up to speed with what I previously learned in Spring Boot and I can start working on my own app. I'd definitely like to look into a note taking software of some sort tomorrow. I did really really well the week I was handwriting my notes and a lot of knowledge stuck, and I feel like that will be extremely useful right now, but I want to find a digital software and see if that works just as well for me.


### Day 16: September 12, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Today I had an interview for the Java role that I am extremely excited about! I would absolutely love to work for this company because I know that the possibilities would be endless and that I would learn so much! I'm definitely up for the challenge!!! I also finished my remake of my To-Do application. I'm pretty happy with the outcome and feel like it's a lot more dynamic this time around. I'm sure there could be some changes done but I'm going to continue on to the next project. I achieved what I wanted to with it, which was to take a more Object Oriented approach and break it into smaller pieces!

**Thoughts:** I'll be spending my weekend in Java. Reviewing is bringing a lot of stuff back to my brain, but I've just been so heavily focused on JavaScript concepts. So tomorrow I will continue with my review and code some more! I'm going to start reviewing backend concepts because I think a lot of it has vanished from my brain and I need to find it again!


### Day 15: September 11, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: I spent the day reviewing Java terms/definitions and just reviewing for interviews! Nothing too crazy! Lots of flash cards and trying to research/understand specific concepts.

**Thoughts:** I really need to review a lot of Java backend. I haven't touched it in a few weeks and I know I'm rusty for sure.


### Day 14: September 10, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Again another busy day and not a ton of coding! Scheduled all of my checkup Dr appts this week and needed to take my doggo to the vet, so busy busy! I messed around with Vue for a little bit this morning after I woke up. I got 2 emails/calls today for 2 more interviews this week! One is my 4th interview with a company, the other is my first. I'm extremely excited for both! Both are Java roles, so I spent some time tonight reviewing a little Java. Tomorrow will be a full Java review day!

**Thoughts:** JAVA JAVA JAVA JAVA JAVA. I need to get better at Java! I'm letting imposter syndrome get to me a bit, but I definitely know I am capable of learning what I need to learn for both of these roles! It's just a matter of getting me exposed to it an in the role! It's been really difficult bouncing back and forth between Java and JavaScript. My interview the other day was for JS. So I've been through a good amount of interviews, but I'm trying to keep my brain straight because I'm going JS interview, Java interview, JS interview, Java interview. I have to keep switching gears! It's definitely keeping me on my toes and constantly learning for sure.


### Day 13: September 9, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Interview today! Also took a little bit to expose myself to Vue.js because the company that I interviewded for uses Vue.

**Thoughts:** Vue seems overall pretty easy to grasp. Didn't get to spend much time on it, but enough to see a few of the differences from React.


### Day 12: September 8, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Today was a busy day. Not much coding, but solved 2 challenges on HackerRank and fixed the errors in my ToDo app!

**Thoughts:** Not many thoughts today... I noticed I solved the challenges I did on HackerRank fairly quick so I felt pretty good about that. It shows that my thought process is getting better! Interview tomorrow!


### Day 11: September 7, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: I remade my very first ToDo List application that I had made in Java to compare my understanding of when I started vs now. It is much more dynamic. Still more work to be done on it, but feeling happy with how far I've come!

**Thoughts:** Overall completely happy with how far my thought process has come/developed. I still have a long way to go, but Java is definitely helping me approach programs more thoughtfully.


### Day 10: September 6, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Today I had the interview! I'm not sure how I did and there were a lot of terms about Java that I've heard but did not know more in depth. For whatever reason I thought you had to initialize the garbage collector in Java. I knew about garbage collection for memory management but was not sure how it worked at all in Java. I also did not know the difference between a TreeMap and a TreeSet. I was asked about Vectors and ArrayList and which one was synchronized. I knew about both uses of them but I wasn't sure which was synchronized, and guessed Vector because I was pretty sure that ArrayLists were not. I was also asked about SOAP vs REST. I know REST API but have never worked with SOAP. I had done some research on it in the past but it completely slipped my memory what the differences were. So all the questions that I was unsure of/thought I missed, I did research on them after the interview.

**Thoughts:** I have a lot to learn!!! Java is a very in depth language and I'd love to learn everything I can about it. I still am struggling bouncing back and forth between Java and JavaScript. I've been focusing more on JS because it's what I started with and I feel like I have a better chance to get a job with what I have more knowledge in. But either way, even though bouncing back and forth has been a struggle, I've learned SO MUCH in the process. So we will see where this goes!


### Day 9: September 5, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: I spent the whole day trying to prep for an interview. I've been heavily focusing on JavaScript and have barely touched Java in a minute... but a random interview came up for Java that I did not expect! So I went through a TON of Angie Jones' Java Tutorial... It helped significantly to refresh the syntax and I even picked up a ton of stuff I didn't know. I squished as much into my brain as I could.

**Thoughts:** After watching a huge chunk of that course, I feel so much more comfortable about what exactly Object Oriented Programming is and how it works. I FINALLY understand Polymorphism, at least at a beginner level. So I'm super excited!

### Day 8: September 4, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Watched a little bit of the Udemy course I'm working through.. Didn't do much actual coding, BUT I did work on the presentation of my Github. I still need to go through it more. I'm working on getting it in more order, deleting projects that I had to miscellaneously upload for my bootcamp that aren't totally complete, and just getting it tidied up. Also went through and began documenting them more with ReadMe files. Tomorrow hopefully I can complete this task and get it all in order.

**Thoughts:** Realizing that even days of not actual coding, are still completely necessary to keep my files/tech stuff straight!


### Day 7: September 3, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Watched 2 Egghead videos about TypeScript. I did a bit of practice with it, just exploring types/using DOM elements. Learned about how to use interfaces/classes as well. 

**Thoughts:** I'm really excited to work with TypeScript more! It seems like a great way to practice structuring my code better. It reminds me a lot of Java. It's going to be a difficult transition, because I remember how much I struggled trying to go from JS to Java in the beginning! Took me a minute to get used to using types. But I love the structure. It's more code, but I really think it helps your code come together better in the end.

### Day 6: September 2, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Finished Section 4 of the Advanced JavaScript Concepts Udemy Course. Topics included - 
* Primitive vs Non-Primitive Data types in JS
* Undefined - absence of a definition, Null - absence of a value
* Array.isArray() to check for array type because typeof will only show you that an array is an object
* Pass by Reference vs Pass by Value - objects are pass by reference, pointing to a specific place in memory. Primitive data types are pass by value and contain their own seperate places in memory, rather than point to one location.
* How to clone an object or array so prevent any issues caused by pass by reference
* Object.assign(), spread operator for shallow clones (one layer)
* JSON.parse(JSON.stringify()) for deep cloning -- but this can cause performance issues if the object is large
* Type Coersion when using a double equals sign
* Object.is for comparison
* Static typing in JS using FLow, Elm, ReasonML, or TypeScript

**Thoughts:** A little review again, but refreshed a lot of knowledge on pass by reference vs pass by value and how to deep clone. I looked up some info and it seems like that can get pretty complex. I'm excited to be on to Section 5 because it contains a lot of completely new knowledge, so I'm looking forward to learning it all. I'd also like to maybe start including some TypeScript in my work and maybe run through an Egghead course to get a quick idea of it. I've used it a tiny bit in the past, but mostly forget it. I've noticed a lot of employers want TypeScript, so it's on my list to review. I may work on an algorithm tonight as well, or at least review the Check Permutations algorithm.

### Day 5: September 1, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Finished Section 3 of the Advanced JavaScript Concepts Udemy course. A little review, but learned some things a lot more in depth. Todays topics included -
* Leakage of global variables - 'use strict' prevents this from happening
* Function Scope vs Block Scope - var is function scoped, Example: can be accessed outside of if/for loop, let and const are block scoped and can only be accessed inside a block of code
* Variable collision and why it is important to not pollute the global environment with variables. Other script files will overwrite each other if there are variables of the same name.
* IIFE - Immediately Invoked Function Expression, help to prevent variable collision by creating a local environment.
* 'this' keyword - the object that the function is a property of, gives methods access to their object and also can execute same code for multiple objects. The 'this' keyword is dynamically scoped rather than lexically scope (this is fixed by either using an arrow function or .bind(this). You can also create a reference to 'this' by creating a variable in the obj you are referencing.
* call(), apply(), bind() - call and apply both borrow methods from objects, bind stores a method to be used later
* Function currying - uses bind() to give partial parameters (first parameter) to other functions
* context vs scope

**Thoughts:** These are topics I've covered a little in the past but they never sunk in completely. I'm taking a lot of notes to hopefully help me remember better. It's already a lot easier to understand this now with a year of coding under my belt. When I tried to understand these topics previously, it was more difficult to understand them without much knowledge. So outside of taking notes, I think just having more overall knowledge is helping it sink in more easily.

### Day 4: August 31, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the check permutations algorithm and practiced using Maps in JavaScript. Read about the various Map methods and how to use them

**Thoughts:** I feel like I'm pretty close to a good solution, but I might have used too many for loops and also feel like I didn't follow the DRY principle as well as I should have.. I will check for solutions tomorrow and compare to what I got. But I believe my solution works from what I can tell. It's late though so I will double check after a night of rest!

### Day 3: August 30, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: I continued Andrei Neagoie's Advanced JavaScript Concepts Udemy course. Topics covered today include -
* Execution Context - JS engine creates global() execution context. Access to Global object(window) and "this" keyword
* Lexical Environment - every time we create an execution context, a new lexical environment is created.
* Hoisting - only var and function declaration get hoisted
* Function Invocation - access to "this" keyword and "arguments" keyword (which is an object)
* Array.from() turns arguments into an array. Can also use rest parameters
* Variable environments
* Scope Chain - each execution context has a connection to its parent

I also began another algorithm from Cracking the Coding Interview. I'm learning about creating a Map to check for permutations of a string. Have not solved it yet and need to look into comparing Maps. I did solve it one way, which involved sorting the string and comparing, but it is not the most optimized way.

**Thoughts:** Some of the topics covered today were review because I do know a lot of this stuff, and I use a lot of these concepts. I think I just forget what a lot of it is actually called! I didn't get to spend a lot of time on the algorithm today but I started learning about how to use Maps, which seems comparible to something I'd see in Java. So I'll be exploring this more tomorrow.

### Day 2: August 29, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Unfortunately I had a migraine most of today so I didn't get much in after applying to jobs... but I was able to practice an algorithm from Cracking the Coding Interview. I learned about using Sets in JavaScript, which I did not know existed. I did tried two different functions to check if a string has unique characters. One way was with a Set, the other I tried character codes like I had learned in Java. I only did it was ASCII and not Unicode.

**Thoughts:** Wishing I made more progress today but I'm happy I learned about Sets. It will be very useful in the future. I also enjoy finding multiple ways to solve one problem. Tomorrow I'd like to get back to the Advanced JavaScript Concepts course, and try another algorithm.

### Day 1: August 28, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Today I finished section 2 of Andrei Neagoie's Advanced JavaScript Concepts Udemy course. I also started an algorithm from Cracking the Coding Interview that I want to cover more deeply tomorrow because I know there is a way to do it with ASCII checks. I learned several concepts that I had forgotten over time. The topics I covered today are -- 

-- The JavaScript Engine

-- JS being both an interpreted and a compiled language, depending on the implementation of it.

-- Interpreters and compilers - interpreters translate line by line on the fly and compilers work ahead of time to create the translation. Interpreters are quick to get up and running, but code is not as optimized as a compiled language.

-- JIT compiler - JS now interprets and compiles, best of both worlds - the profiler watches the code and makes notes on how to optimize it.

-- inline caching and hidden classes

-- Web Assembly

-- Call Stack and Memory Heap - the call stack keeps track of where we are in the code, memory heap is where we allocate, use, and release memory

-- JS is a single threaded language - 1 call stack, 1 memory heap

-- Garbage collection & memory leaks

-- JavaScript Runtime & Web API

-- Event loop and callback queue


**Thoughts:** Today was a busy day of JS foundational knowledge. I learned a ton about how the language works behind the scenes, which I know will help my thought process when coding. I actually decided to start hand writing my notes because I think that will help this knowledge sink in more. I cleared out my Repl account and wanted to start using it to try an algorithm a day(maybe not every day but I'm going to try!). I want to dive deeper into the unique character checker. I know there is a much more efficient way to check than what I am doing because I've done it in Java before... but I think I'm not sure how to convert that to JavaScript. So I'm going to try to link these two thought processes for these languages together so I can better understand concepts and worry less about syntax.
