# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 28, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Today I finished section 2 of Andrei Neagoie's Advanced JavaScript Concepts Udemy course. I also started an algorithm from Cracking the Coding Interview that I want to cover more deeply tomorrow because I know there is a way to cover it way ASCII checking. I learned several concepts that I had forgotten over time. The topics I covered today are -- 
-- The JavaScript Engine
-- JS being both an interpreted and a compiled language, depending on the implementation of it.
-- Interpreters and compilers - interpreters translate line by line on the fly and compilers work ahead of time to create the translation. Interpreters are quick to get up and running, but code is not as optimized as a compiled language.
-- JIT compiler - JS now interprets and compiles, best of both worlds - the profiler watches the code and makes notes on how to optimize it.
-- inline caching and hidden classes
-- Web Assembly
-- Call Stack and Memory Heap - the call stack keeps track of where we are in the code, memory heap is where we allocate, use, and release memory
-- JS is a single threaded language - 1 call stack, 1 memory heap
-- Garbage collection & memory leaks
-- JavaScript Runtime & Web API
-- Event loop and callback queue


**Thoughts:** Today was a busy day of JS foundational knowledge. I learned a ton about how the language works behind the scenes, which I know will help my thought process when coding. I actually decided to start hand writing my notes because I think that will help this knowledge sink in more. I cleared out my Repl account and wanted to start using it to try an algorithm a day(maybe not every day but I'm going to try!). I want to dive deeper into a unique character checker. I know there is a much more efficient way to check than what I am doing because I've done it in Java before... but I think I'm not sure how to convert that to JavaScript. So I'm going to try to link these two thought processes for these languages together so I can better understand concepts and worry less about syntax.
