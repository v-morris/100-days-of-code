# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 15, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Worked more with React app and learned how to dynamically add CSS classes by pushing to an array and using inline styling. Also learned about Radium, which allows you to use pseudo selectors and media queries with inline styling.

**Thoughts:** Very useful knowledge because when I previously worked with React apps this crossed my mind. Thought pseudo selectors and media queries could only be done through style sheets. Radium is going to be extremely helpful for my future React websites.

### Day 2: March 16, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Continued through tutorial and learned about npm run eject to add CSS Modules to React App. CSS modules allowed you to scope css files to specific JS files. You can also add pseudo classes and media queries this way. I also started a layout for a React Calculator. Basic layout is done but no functionality yet.

**Thoughts:** CSS modules seems useful but I want to do more research into what is possible with ejecting the React app. I also saw in the warnings that CSS modules are possible without ejecting the app, so I want to do more research into that as well.
