# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 15, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Worked more with React app and learned how to dynamically add CSS classes by pushing to an array and using inline styling. Also learned about Radium, which allows you to use pseudo selectors and media queries with inline styling.

**Thoughts:** Very useful knowledge because when I previously worked with React apps this crossed my mind. Thought pseudo selectors and media queries could only be done through style sheets. Radium is going to be extremely helpful for my future React websites.

### Day 2: March 16, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Continued through tutorial and learned about npm run eject to add CSS Modules to React App. CSS modules allowed you to scope css files to specific JS files. You can also add pseudo classes and media queries this way. I also started a layout for a React Calculator. Basic layout is done but no functionality yet.

**Thoughts:** CSS modules seems useful but I want to do more research into what is possible with ejecting the React app. I also saw in the warnings that CSS modules are possible without ejecting the app, so I want to do more research into that as well.

### Day 3: March 17, 2019 & Day 4: March 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Didn't have a chance to update this yesterday but I did watch some of Andrea Neagoie's JavaScript tutorial on Udemy. Also watched a full tutorial on React Calculator to help my thought process while building. Made more progress on my own without having to go back and rewatch tutorial. Had to do a little research of my own though outside of it.

**Thoughts:** The tutorial I watched for the calculator really helped my entire thought process and will help me with future React apps as well. I've learned several smaller concepts involving state and what I should be thinking when I need to update it.

### Day 5: March 19, 2019 & Day 6: March 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Really need to remember to update this! Had apartment issues the 19th so got to only do a little work on the calculator. Today (20th) I completed the calculator and put in the functions. I did need some assistance from a tutorial, but I learned the easiest way to do the functions in React. I also added in if statements to make sure the display does not grow past its width limits, and turns to exponents if the value is too large.

**Thoughts:** The calculator functions were challenging to me at first because I just did not know the best way to write it without adding in a bunch of if/else statements. The original way I was doing it was working, but I could not get it to update the display value accurately unless I clicked equals twice. The calculator taught me a lot as far as functions/calculations go and how to think about state throughout the developing process.

### Day 7: March 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I spent a lot of the day applying to jobs, but I spent some time near the end working on some Ruby tutorials on Codecademy. I want to start building/practicing more with React/Rails applications, so I need a better base knowledge.

**Thoughts:** I'm really looking forward to getting the basics with Ruby and Rails down because there is a project I want to revisit for a job I previously applied to. I've noticed a lot of places still use Rails so I think this skill will definitely be useful.

### Day 8: March 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I went through a ton of Codecademy's Ruby tutorials to fill in gaps in my knowledge.

**Thoughts:** Ruby is very easy to pick up. Going through the tutorials, I really didn't know much off hand but everything with Ruby makes sense and flows with how I think. No surprises with what the code means so far, although I did stumble a bit with a loop I was practicing with it.

### Day 9: March 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I unfortunately had to spend most of my day resetting my computer because I bought an SSD and needed to reinstall everything. But I did some Ruby on Rails coding at the end and I'm going through a tutorial on how to make a basic React/Rails app using the react-rails gem. After I complete this I plan on revisiting a previous project.

**Thoughts:** This is a lot easier the second time around and the tutorials I've been doing also helped significantly. I can see why Rails is still popular because it is so easy to get something up and running quickly.

### Day 10: March 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Made a quick HTML form and basic stying with CSS. Learned about the "focus" selector. I really want to expand on my CSS knowledge more. Feel like I have several gaps in my knowledge. Didn't have a ton of time today so I'm going to get back to the Ruby app tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** 
I really need to look at some web design/app designs for inspiration. Any time I go to style something on my own I end up not liking how it looks and I'm not sure why! I'm hoping that practicing CSS more with my applications will help with this, as I feel like I have a ton of ideas but I'm not always sure how to execute the design. More work with basic CSS is needed and I'm going to start putting more work into that too as I create my applications.

### Day 11: March 25, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Fruits CRUD App/Tutorial made with Rails and React. I added in the Add/Delete Functions.

**Thoughts:** 
Much easier time understanding than the first time I made the employee app for a job interview. Can't wait to go back and retry it. My React skills are definitely better and since I've gone through some Ruby tutorials, I'm grasping it much better as well. Tomorrow I will probably be able to start the employee application/database again.
